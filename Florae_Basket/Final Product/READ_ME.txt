This is the final product for our flower system. 

When launched, a user will have to input a user name and password to use the system.
	There is a default username and password that launch with the system, which are:
		username: Admin
		password: Admin
	Once a user is in the system with the Admin defaults, they can add themselves/other users and access their accounts that way.

Our final turn in has a database populated with 19 users (found in the users.csv file).

Our database is also populated with 13 flowers:
	Cactus
	Daisy
	Rose
	California Poppy
	Sunflower
	Catmint
	Daffodil
	Glory of the Snow
	Leadwort
	Moonflower
	Pansy
	Periwinkle
	Petunia

Any of these flowers can be searched for. Users can also add their own flowers, or remove any that we added.
